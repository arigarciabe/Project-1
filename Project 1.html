<h1> This is the heading </h1>
<p> With this attribute, <br/> I create a paragraph and if I want to <b>bold</b> a specific word <br> I use <b>this</b> attribute </p>
<p> To emphasize a text I use this <em>attribute</em>, this basically <em>italicize</em> something. </p>
<p> With the div <div> tag, like its name, creates division creating a line break. </p>
<p> Last example is the span tag <span> has no visual alterations within itself but can be useful for specific styles in a paragraph.</span> </p>
